### ABOUT KEY_TRAINER ###

This program has been created to help people learn blind typing. It supports only two layouts - english and russian.

Key_trainer shows current keyboard layout in a separate window. It also colors buttons to show which finger should push it.

It is Linux only. Currently tested on Ubuntu 14.04, Linux Mint 17 Quiana MATE 64 and 32 bits editions.
